## Humble Beginnings
I started running regularly in July of 2024, after watching this video: [The Art of Showing Up](https://youtu.be/UJzh8X4Z8ys?si=h7gG4wdTHPdRiZep) by Life of Riza. In that video she documented her visiting the New York Marathon to cheer for her friends, and she described running in a beautiful manner, which inspired me to try it out for myself. 

I had tried running a few times in my first year of university, but it always felt like a chore (probably because I ran on the treadmill). My running goals were never to increase endurance but rather to run as fast as I could for as far as I could, which made running a very unpleasant experience no matter what. But the perspective that Riza offered about simply showing up gave me a mental boost to try again, but this time slower, and more methodical. 

The method a year ago was to just run 1 mile every day faster than the previous day. I wanted to feel like I made progress so I started of really slow (about 14 min miles...) This is slow but honestly I was and to a certain extent still am very unfit. But as I ran those 14 minute miles, surprisingly and luckily I found it enjoyable to run slower as it helped me clear my head. 

As I always like to do with new hobbies, I looked up all sorts of resources to help me get faster, quicker. I found a reddit post that said in order to run fast, "you need to run slow, like really slow." So I looked into that and got into a whole rabbit hole about heart rate zones bla bla. 

But by this time I just really enjoyed the solitude running gave me so I pursued it just for the joy of it. It is also September/October by this time and the fall colors are beautiful there is literally no reason to not go out and run. I still ran 14 (often more) min miles but I slowly extended my runs. 
## Current Progress

Currently I'm running 10Ks almost every week! I feel more than amazing about the progress I've made so far. I also run intervals on Tuesdays and have a very good running schedule. I still run for the joy of it, more than  chasing any particular distance or time. However, I would like to get a faster 5K, 10K and get to a half marathon, but I am willing to achieve those goals slowly as long as I continue enjoying running and can keep this up for a longer period of time. 

My heart rate has gone down significantly as well, as low as high 150s and low 160s compares to high 160s and low 170s even on easy runs. So progress is definitely measurable, in terms of my ability. I also haven't done an all out 5K yet, and I feel like I could get a PB on that as well.
## What worked?

So far the things that worked are my discipline. I've kept showing up even when I didn't feel like it. I have started running and finished runs while walking and even though that seems like a bad run, its something in the books. I'm proud of continuing to show up, I think that might be my strength.
## What didn't work? 
I'm really bad at keeping track. I switched phones in the middle of this and now I have an Apple watch and a Pixel phone and they do not like each other so my day to day training isn't saved. I kind of like that though because it means I don't measure progress on really small details
