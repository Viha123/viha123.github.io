                Hello, I'm Viha, a junior at San Jose State University studying Computer Science! 
                I'm interested in <strong className = "text-peach-150"> embedded systems, full-stack development, and computer science </strong>. 
                I'm looking for internships for Fall 2025, and job opportunities starting 2026. I will be internshing at Shield AI in the summer as a C++ Sofware Engineering Intern.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                At school, I'm involved in the <strong className='text-peach-150'>SJSU Robotics Club</strong>, where I'm the Controls Lead. 
                I work on the controls systems for our robot, and I have written drivers in <strong className='text-peach-150'>C++ </strong>for our sensors and actuators.
                I've learned how to use the Arduino IDE, and I've worked with the LPC4078 microcontroller and the STM32 microcontroller. I have also interfaced with many communication 
                protocols such as <strong className='text-peach-150'>I2C, SPI and UART.</strong> Some of the sensors I worked with are: MPU6050, BME680, and the OPT4048.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Some of the classes I've taken at SJSU are: <strong className='text-peach-150'>Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Database Management Systems, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Object Oriented Programming.</strong>
                I am going to take: <strong className='text-peach-150'>Computer Graphics, Computer architecture and Information Systems</strong> next semester.
                I've also taken an online AI course at Harvard, where I learned about search algorithms, Markov Decision Processes, and reinforcement learning.
                I'm also interested in learning about Compilers and lower level technologies.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                When I'm not coding, I like to play volleyball &#x1F3D0;, run üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, climb üßóüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, read &#x1F4DA; and watch Bollywood movies &#x1F3A5;. I also love listening to Music. &#x1F3A7;
